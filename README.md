# Play & ReactiveMongo, assignment

Objective is to implement a really simple CRUD for a contact database, using Play Framework and MongoDb with ReactiveMongo. A template controller (`controllers.ContactController`) is provided. You should implement the function stubs so that the application is able to create, update, read, list and delete contacts.
 
You will need Java JDK 8 and MongoDB installed. Start the sbt-console by running the activator-script found in the project root. From the console run the project with command `run` and head to address (http://localhost:9000)[http://localhost:9000] with your browser. 

Help and documentation can be found at:

## Data model

The database consists of contact records. A contact has the following form:

```
{
  _id: String, autogenerated,
  firstName: String, required,
  lastName: String, required,
  email: String, required,
  phone: String, optional,
  city: String, optional
}
```

Data model should be validated on the input, so that no invalid data ends up in the database. Invalid input should return HTTP status `BAD REQUEST`. You can use the "Coast-to-coast"-json approach or create domain objects for validation. 

# Configure MongoDB

Just change it in conf/application.conf

```
mongodb.uri = "mongodb://localhost/contacts"
```

# Run it

```
./activator run
```

# Contacts

Template for Contacts controller is provided. Implement the function stubs so that the application provides the following REST-services

## Add some contacts

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"john.doe@example.org}' http://localhost:9000/contacts
```

## List contacts

```
curl  http://localhost:9000/contacts
```

## Update existing contact

Use a contact id from the list of contacts fetched with the list service

```
curl -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"doe.john@example.org}' http://localhost:9000/contacts/<contactId>
```

## Get a specific contact

Use a contact id from the list of contacts fetched with the list service

```
curl  http://localhost:9000/contacts/<contactId>
```

## Delete a specific contact

Use a contact id from the list of contacts fetched with the list service

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9000/contacts/<contactId>
```


## Test invalid formats

The input doesn't contain all the required fields, so it should return a status `BAD REQUEST`.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '[{"firstName": "pepe"}]' http://localhost:9000/contacts
```
